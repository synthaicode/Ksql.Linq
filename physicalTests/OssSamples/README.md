# OSS Sample API Tests

Integration tests that exercise the public API using sample code.

## Active physical tests

Currently, only the following OssSamples tests are compiled into `Ksql.Linq.Tests.Integration`:

- `TranslationsTimeBucketTests.cs`
- `BarTranslationsSmokeTests.cs`
- `BarTxYearTests.cs`

Other historical/sample tests have been moved under `OssSamples/Archive/` and are **not** part of the physical test suite.
