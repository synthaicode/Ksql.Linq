# Release v1.0.0 summary (20251130)

- Framed the 1.0 story in `docs/releases/release_v1_0_0.md`, outlining the AI Assistant Guide/CLI packaging, the `dotnet ksql ai-assist` entry command, and the multilingual headers/footers that keep AI entry texts contextual.
- Added the formal `v1.0.0` changelog entry so the public history now highlights the guide packaging, CLI assist command, localization support, and the updated CI steps that generate/verify `AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md` for both the library and CLI.
